    "The _mapping_ starts with a `base class`, which above is called `Base`, and is created by calling upon the `declarative_base()` function, which produces a __new `base` class__.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Individual mapped classes_ are then _created_ by making __subclasses of `Base`__. A _mapped class_ typically refers to a `single particular database table`, the name of which is indicated by using the __`__tablename__`__ _class-level attribute_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, _columns_ that are part of the table are declared, by _adding attributes_ __linked__ to the `Column` construct. `Column` describes _all aspects_ of a `database column`, including __typing information__ with _type objects_ such as `Integer` and `String` as well as __server defaults__ and __constraint information__, such as _membership_ within the `primary key` and `foreign keys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_All_ `ORM mapped classes` __require__ _at least_ __one column__ be declared as part of the `primary key`, typically by using the `Column.primary_key` parameter on those `Column` objects that should be part of the key. In the above example, the `User.id` and `Address.id` columns are _marked_ as __primary key__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the _combination_ of a `string table name` as well as a `list of column declarations` is __referred__ towards in SQLAlchemy as __`table metadata`__. Setting up `table metadata` using both `Core` and `ORM` approaches is introduced in the `SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 Tutorial` at `Working with Database Metadata`. The above mapping is an example of what's referred towards as `Declarative Table configuration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other _Declarative directives_ are available, most commonly the `relationship()` construct indicated above. In contrast to the _column-based attributes_, `relationship()` denotes a __linkage between two `ORM classes`__. In the above example, `User.addresses` __links `User` to `Address`__, and `Address.user` __links `Address` to `User`__. The `relationship()` construct is introduced in the `SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 Tutorial` at `Working with Related Objects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the above example classes include a `__repr__()` method, which is _not required_ but is __useful for debugging__."
