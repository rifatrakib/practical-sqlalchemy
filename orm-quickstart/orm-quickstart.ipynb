Setting up `table metadata` using both `Core` and `ORM` approaches is introduced in the `SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 Tutorial` at `Working with Database Metadata`. The above mapping is an example of what's referred towards as `Declarative Table configuration`.\n",

In contrast to the _column-based attributes_, `relationship()` denotes a __linkage between two `ORM classes`__. In the above example, `User.addresses` __links `User` to `Address`__, and `Address.user` __links `Address` to `User`__.
