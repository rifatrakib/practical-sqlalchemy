For example, the `join()` function _creates a selectable unit comprised of multiple tables_, complete with its own __composite primary key__, which can be mapped in the same way as a `Table`."

    "In the example above, the _join_ expresses columns for both the _user_ and the _address_ table. The `user.id` and `address.user_id` columns are __equated by foreign key__, so _in the mapping_ they are __defined as one attribute__, `AddressUser.id`, using `column_property()` to __indicate a specialized column mapping__. Based on this part of the _configuration_, the _mapping_ will __copy new primary key values__ *from user.id into the address.user_id* column when a flush occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the `address.id` column is __mapped explicitly__ to an attribute named `address_id`. This is to __disambiguate__ the mapping of the `address.id` column from the _same-named_ `AddressUser.id` attribute, which here has been assigned to __refer to the user table combined with the address.user_id foreign key__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _natural primary key_ of the above mapping is the _composite_ of (`user.id`, `address.id`), as these are the _primary key_ columns of the _user_ and _address_ table __combined together__. The identity of an `AddressUser` object will be in terms of these two values, and is represented from an `AddressUser` object as (`AddressUser.id`, `AddressUser.address_id`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When referring to the `AddressUser.id` column, _most SQL expressions_ will make use of __only the first column__ in the list of columns mapped, as the _two columns_ are __synonymous__. However, for the special use case such as a `GROUP BY` expression where __both columns must be referenced__ at the _same time_ while making use of the _proper context_, that is, accommodating for _aliases and similar_, the accessor `Comparator.expressions` may be used:\n",

    "> A _mapping against multiple tables_ as illustrated above __supports persistence__, that is, _INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE_ of rows within the targeted tables. However, it __does not support__ an operation that would _UPDATE one table_ and _perform INSERT or DELETE on others_ at the same time for one record. That is, if a record _PtoQ_ is mapped to tables `\"p\"` and `\"q\"`, where it has a row based on a _LEFT OUTER JOIN_ of `\"p\" and \"q\"`, if an _UPDATE_ proceeds that is to _alter data_ in the `\"q\"` table in an existing record, the `row in \"q\"` __must exist__; it __won't emit__ an `INSERT` if the _primary key identity_ is __already present__. If the _row does not exist_, for most DBAPI drivers which support reporting the _number of rows affected_ by an `UPDATE`, the _ORM_ will __fail to detect an updated row and raise an error__; otherwise, the data would be _silently ignored_.\n",

The _user-supplied logic_ would __have to detect__ that the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` _from \"p\" to \"q\"_ __does not have an entry__ for the `\"q\"` side."
