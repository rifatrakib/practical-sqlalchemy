    "#### Concrete Table Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "`Concrete inheritance` __maps each subclass to its own distinct table__, each of which contains __all columns necessary__ to produce an instance of that class. A _concrete inheritance configuration_ by default __queries non-polymorphically__; a query for a particular class will only query that class' table and only return instances of that class. _Polymorphic loading of concrete classes_ is enabled by __configuring within the mapper__ a _special_ `SELECT` that typically is produced as a `UNION` of _all the tables_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Warning\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _Concrete table inheritance_ is __much more complicated__ than _joined or single table inheritance_, and is __much more limited in functionality__ especially pertaining to _using it with relationships_, `eager loading`, and `polymorphic loading`. When used _polymorphically_ it produces _very large queries with UNIONS_ that __won't perform as well as simple joins__. It is strongly advised that if _flexibility_ in `relationship loading` and `polymorphic loading` is required, that _joined or single table inheritance_ be used if at all possible. If `polymorphic loading` isn't required, then _plain non-inheriting mappings_ can be used if each class refers to its own table completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas _joined and single table inheritance_ are __fluent__ in `\"polymorphic\" loading`, it is a _more awkward affair_ in `concrete inheritance`. For this reason, _concrete inheritance_ is __more appropriate__ when __polymorphic loading is not required__. Establishing relationships that involve concrete inheritance classes is also more awkward.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a class as using _concrete inheritance_, add the `mapper.concrete` parameter within the `__mapper_args__`. This indicates to _Declarative_ as well as the mapping that the _superclass table_ __should not be considered as part of the mapping__."

    "As discussed in `Loading Inheritance Hierarchies`, _mapper inheritance configurations_ of any type __can be configured__ to _load from a special selectable_ by default using the `mapper.with_polymorphic` argument. Current public API requires that this argument is set on a _Mapper_ when it is first constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of _Declarative_, both the _mapper_ and the _Table that is mapped_ are __created at once__, the moment the mapped class is defined.

    "In a _concrete inheritance_ scenario, _mapping relationships_ is `challenging` since the __distinct classes do not share a table__. If the relationships only involve specific classes, such as a relationship between _Company_ in our previous examples and _Manager_, special steps aren't needed as these are just two related tables.\n",
