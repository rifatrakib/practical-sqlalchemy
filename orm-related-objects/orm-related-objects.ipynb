    "In this section, we will cover one more _essential ORM concept_, which is __how the ORM interacts with mapped classes that refer to other objects__. In the section `Declaring Mapped Classes`, the _mapped class_ examples made use of a construct called `relationship()`. This construct __defines a linkage__ between _two different mapped classes_, or from a _mapped class to itself_, the _latter_ of which is called a __`self-referential relationship`__. To describe the _basic idea_ of `relationship()`, first we'll review the mapping in short form, omitting the _Column mappings_ and other directives."

    "`Lazy loading` is one of the __most famous__ _ORM patterns_, and is also the one that is __most controversial__. When _several dozen ORM objects in memory_ each refer to a _handful of unloaded attributes_, `routine manipulation` of these objects can __spin off many additional queries__ that __`can add up`__ (otherwise known as the __`N plus one problem`__), and to make matters __`worse`__ they are __emitted implicitly__. These _implicit queries_ `may not be noticed`, may __cause errors__ when they are _attempted_ __after__ there's _no longer a database transaction available_, or when using __alternative concurrency patterns__ such as `asyncio`, they actually __won't work__ at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, _lazy loading_ is a __vastly `popular` and `useful` pattern__ when it is _compatible_ with the __concurrency approach__ in use and __isn't otherwise causing problems__. For these reasons, SQLAlchemy's ORM places a _lot of emphasis_ on being able to `control` and `optimize` this _loading behavior_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, the __first step__ in _using ORM lazy loading_ __`effectively`__ is to `test the application`, `turn on SQL echoing`, and `watch the SQL` that is __emitted__. If there seem to be _lots of redundant_ `SELECT statements` that _look very much like_ they could be __`rolled into one` much more efficiently__, if there are `loads` __occurring inappropriately__ for objects that have been __detached__ from their `Session`, that's when to _look into using_ __`loader strategies`__.\n",
    "\n",
