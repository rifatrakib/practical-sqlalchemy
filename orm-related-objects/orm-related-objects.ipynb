In the section `Declaring Mapped Classes`, the _mapped class_ examples made use of a construct called `relationship()`. This construct __defines a linkage__ between _two different mapped classes_, or from a _mapped class to itself_, the _latter_ of which is called a __`self-referential relationship`__. To describe the _basic idea_ of `relationship()`, first we'll review the mapping in short form, omitting the _Column mappings_ and other directives."

    "##### Using Relationships to Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections `Explicit FROM clauses and JOINs` and `Setting the ON Clause` introduced the usage of the `Select.join()` and `Select.join_from()` methods to __compose__ _SQL JOIN clauses_. In order to describe __how to join between tables__, these methods either __infer__ the `ON clause` based on the presence of a _single unambiguous_ `ForeignKeyConstraint` object within the _table metadata structure_ that links the two tables, or otherwise we may _provide_ an __explicit__ `SQL Expression construct` that __indicates a specific ON clause__.\n",
    "\n",
    "When _using ORM entities_, an _additional mechanism_ is available to help us set up the `ON clause` of a _join_, which is to make use of the `relationship()` objects that we set up in our user _mapping_, as was demonstrated at `Declaring Mapped Classes`. The _class-bound attribute_ corresponding to the `relationship()` may be passed as the __single argument__ to `Select.join()`, where it serves to __indicate both the `right side of the join` as well as the `ON clause` `at once`__."
