    "In this section, we will cover one more _essential ORM concept_, which is __how the ORM interacts with mapped classes that refer to other objects__. In the section `Declaring Mapped Classes`, the _mapped class_ examples made use of a construct called `relationship()`. This construct __defines a linkage__ between _two different mapped classes_, or from a _mapped class to itself_, the _latter_ of which is called a __`self-referential relationship`__. To describe the _basic idea_ of `relationship()`, first we'll review the mapping in short form, omitting the _Column mappings_ and other directives."
