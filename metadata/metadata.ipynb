    "With engines and SQL execution down, we are ready to begin some `Alchemy`. The central element of both `SQLAlchemy Core` and `ORM` is the `SQL Expression Language` which allows for fluent, composable construction of SQL queries. The foundation for these queries are _Python objects that represent database concepts like tables and columns_. These objects are known collectively as __database metadata__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common foundational objects for database metadata in SQLAlchemy are known as `MetaData, Table, and Column`. The sections below will illustrate how these objects are used in both a Core-oriented style as well as an ORM-oriented style."

    "When we work with a relational database, the basic structure that we create and query from is known as a `table`. In SQLAlchemy, the `table` is represented by a Python class similarly named `Table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using the `SQLAlchemy Expression Language`, we will want to have `Table` objects constructed that represent all of the database tables we are interested in working with. Each `Table` may be __declared__, meaning we _explicitly spell out in source code what the table looks like_, or may be __reflected__, which means we _generate the object based on whatâ€™s already present in a particular database_. The two approaches can also be blended in many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we will _declare_ or _reflect_ our tables, we start out with a collection that will be where we place our tables known as the `MetaData` object. This object is essentially a `facade around a Python dictionary` that stores a series of `Table` objects keyed to their string name."
