The central element of both `SQLAlchemy Core` and `ORM` is the `SQL Expression Language` which allows for fluent, composable construction of SQL queries.

    "To start using the `SQLAlchemy Expression Language`, we will want to have `Table` objects constructed that represent all of the database tables we are interested in working with. Each `Table` may be __declared__, meaning we _explicitly spell out in source code what the table looks like_, or may be __reflected__, which means we _generate the object based on what’s already present in a particular database_. The two approaches can also be blended in many ways.\n",

Whereas in the previous sections we’ve been declaring `Table` objects in Python and then `emitting DDL` to the database, the reflection process does it in _reverse_.\n",

There are again _some varieties_ of how this is performed, however the __most basic__ is to _construct a `Table` object_, given the _name of the table and a MetaData collection_ to which it will belong, then instead of indicating individual `Column` and `Constraint` objects, _pass it the target `Engine`_ using the `Table.autoload_with` parameter."
