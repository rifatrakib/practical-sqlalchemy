When working with the Core directly, the `Connection` object is how all interaction with the database is done. As the `Connection` represents an open resource against the database, we want to always limit the scope of our use of this object to a specific context, and the best way to do that is by using `Python context manager` form, also known as the `with statement`."

    "Behind the scenes, the `Connection` objects uses a `DBAPI feature` known as `cursor.executemany()`. This method performs the equivalent operation of invoking the given SQL statement against each parameter set individually. The DBAPI _may optimize_ this operation in a variety of ways, __by using prepared statements__, or __by concatenating the parameter sets into a single SQL statement__ in some cases. Some SQLAlchemy dialects _may also use alternate APIs_ for this case, such as the `psycopg2 dialect for PostgreSQL` which uses _more performant APIs_ for this use case."

Multiple parameters also may be used with `UPDATE and DELETE statements` to _emit distinct UPDATE/DELETE operations on a per-row basis_, however again when using the ORM, there is a different technique generally used for updating or deleting many individual rows separately."
