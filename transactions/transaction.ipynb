When working with the Core directly, the `Connection` object is how all interaction with the database is done. As the `Connection` represents an open resource against the database, we want to always limit the scope of our use of this object to a specific context, and the best way to do that is by using `Python context manager` form, also known as the `with statement`."

Some SQLAlchemy dialects _may also use alternate APIs_ for this case, such as the `psycopg2 dialect for PostgreSQL` which uses _more performant APIs_ for this use case."
