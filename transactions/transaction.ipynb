    "With the `Engine` object ready to go, we may now proceed to dive into the basic operation of an `Engine` and its primary interactive endpoints, the `Connection` and `Result`. We will additionally introduce the `ORM`'s facade for these objects, known as the `Session`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When using the ORM, the `Engine` is managed by another object called the `Session`. The `Session` in modern SQLAlchemy emphasizes a transactional and SQL execution pattern that is largely identical to that of the `Connection` discussed below, so while this subsection is Core-centric, all of the concepts here are essentially relevant to ORM use as well and is recommended for all ORM learners. The execution pattern used by the `Connection` will be contrasted with that of the `Session` at the end of this section."

    "The sole purpose of the `Engine` object from a user-facing perspective is to provide a unit of connectivity to the database called the `Connection`. When working with the Core directly, the `Connection` object is how all interaction with the database is done. As the `Connection` represents an open resource against the database, we want to always limit the scope of our use of this object to a specific context, and the best way to do that is by using `Python context manager` form, also known as the `with statement`."

This method will both manage the scope of the `Connection` and also enclose everything inside of a transaction with `COMMIT at the end, assuming a successful block`, or `ROLLBACK in case of exception raise`.
