    "The `version_id_generator` can also be _configured to rely upon_ a value that is __generated by the database__. In this case, the database would need some means of __generating new identifiers__ when a row is _subject to an INSERT_ as well as with an _UPDATE_. For the _UPDATE_ case, typically an _update trigger_ is needed, unless the database in question supports some other __native version identifier__. The _PostgreSQL_ database in particular supports a _system column_ called `xmin` which __provides UPDATE versioning__. We can make use of the _PostgreSQL_ `xmin` column to version our _User_ class as follows."

The _datatype_ of this column is an _internal PostgreSQL type_ called `xid` which acts mostly __like a string__, so we use the `String` datatype.\n",

    "The ORM typically __does not actively fetch__ the values of _database-generated_ values when it _emits_ an `INSERT` or `UPDATE`, instead leaving these columns as `\"expired\"` and to be fetched when they are _next accessed_, unless the __eager_defaults `mapper()` flag__ is set. However, when a _server side version column_ is used, the ORM __needs to actively fetch__ the _newly generated value_. This is so that the _version counter_ is __set up before any concurrent transaction may update it again__. This fetching is also __best done simultaneously within the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement using `RETURNING`__, otherwise if _emitting a SELECT statement afterwards_, there is still a __potential `race condition`__ where the _version counter_ __may change before it can be fetched__.\n",
