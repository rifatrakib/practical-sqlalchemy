    "#### Custom Collection Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use your own types for collections as well. In simple cases, _inheriting_ from `list` or `set`, _adding custom behavior_, is all that's needed. In other cases, _special decorators_ are needed to tell SQLAlchemy __more detail about how the collection operates__.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ###### Do I need a custom collection implementation?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In most cases not at all! The most common use cases for a \"custom\" collection is one that _validates or marshals incoming values into a new form_, such as a string that becomes a class instance, or one which goes a step beyond and _represents the data internally in some fashion_, presenting a \"view\" of that data on the outside of a different form.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For the first use case, the `validates()` decorator is by far the _simplest way to intercept incoming values_ in all cases for the purposes of __validation and simple marshaling__.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For the second use case, the _Association Proxy extension_ is a _well-tested_, _widely used_ system that provides a __read/write \"view\" of a collection__ in terms of some attribute present on the target object. As the _target attribute_ can be a `@property` that returns virtually _anything_, a _wide array of \"alternative\" views_ of a collection can be constructed with just a few functions. This approach leaves the __underlying mapped collection unaffected and avoids the need to carefully tailor collection behavior on a method-by-method basis__.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _Customized collections_ are useful when the collection needs to have _special behaviors upon access or mutation operations_ that __can't otherwise be modeled externally__ to the collection. They can of course be __combined__ with the _above two approaches_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections in SQLAlchemy are _transparently instrumented_. `Instrumentation` means that _normal operations on the collection are tracked and result in changes being written to the database at flush time_. Additionally, collection operations __can fire events__ which indicate some secondary operation must take place. Examples of a secondary operation include saving the child item in the parent's _Session_ (i.e. the _save-update cascade_), as well as _synchronizing_ the state of a `bi-directional relationship` (i.e. a `backref()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The collections package understands the _basic interface of lists, sets and dicts_ and will __automatically apply instrumentation__ to those built-in types and their subclasses. _Object-derived types_ that implement a basic collection interface are __detected and instrumented via duck-typing__."
