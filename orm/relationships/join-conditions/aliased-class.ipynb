    "#### Relationship to Aliased Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we illustrated a technique where we used _relationship.secondary_ in order to __place additional tables within a join condition__. There is one _complex join_ case where even this technique is __not sufficient__; when we seek to _join from A to B_, making use of _any number of C, D, etc. in between_, however there are also __join conditions between A and B directly__. In this case, the _join from A to B_ may be __difficult to express with just a complex `relationship.primaryjoin` condition__, as the _intermediary tables may need special handling_, and it is also __not expressible__ with a _relationship.secondary_ object, since the `A->secondary->B` pattern __does not support any references between A and B directly__. When this _extremely advanced case_ arises, we can resort to __creating a second mapping__ as a `target` for the _relationship_. This is where we use `AliasedClass` in order to make a _mapping to a class that includes all the additional tables we need for this join_. In order to produce this mapper as an _\"alternative\" mapping_ for our class, we use the `aliased()` function to produce the new construct, then use `relationship()` against the object as though it were a plain mapped class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below illustrates a `relationship()` with a _simple join from A to B_, however the _primaryjoin_ condition is __augmented with two additional entities__ C and D, which also must have rows that line up with the rows in both A and B simultaneously."
