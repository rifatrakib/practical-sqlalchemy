    "The _default behavior_ of `relationship()` when constructing a join is that it __equates the value of primary key columns on one side to that of foreign-key-referring columns on the other__. We __can change__ this criterion to be anything we'd like using the `relationship.primaryjoin` argument, as well as the `relationship.secondaryjoin` argument in the case when a _\"secondary\" table_ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, using the _User_ class as well as an _Address_ class which stores a street address, we create a relationship *boston_addresses* which will only load those Address objects which specify a city of \"Boston\"."

    "Within this string SQL expression, we made use of the `and_()` conjunction construct to __establish two distinct predicates__ for the _join condition_ - joining both the _User.id_ and *Address.user_id* columns to each other, as well as __limiting rows__ in _Address_ to just `city='Boston'`.

    "The custom criteria we use in a `relationship.primaryjoin` is generally __only significant__ when SQLAlchemy is _rendering SQL in order to load or represent this relationship_. That is, it's used in the SQL statement that's emitted in order to _perform a per-attribute lazy load_, or when a join is _constructed at query time_, such as via `Query.join()`, or via the __`eager \"joined\"` or `\"subquery\"` styles of loading__. When _in-memory objects_ are being _manipulated_, we can place any _Address_ object we'd like into the *boston_addresses* collection, regardless of what the value of the `.city` attribute is. The objects will remain __present in the collection until the attribute is expired and re-loaded__ from the database where the criterion is applied. When a _flush_ occurs, the objects inside of *boston_addresses* will be __flushed unconditionally__, assigning value of the primary key _user.id_ column onto the __foreign-key-holding__ *address.user_id* column for each row. The city criteria has __no effect__ here, as the _flush process_ only cares about __synchronizing primary key values into referencing foreign key values__."
