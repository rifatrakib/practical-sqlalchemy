    "#### Composite `\"Secondary\"` Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when one seeks to build a `relationship()` between two tables there is a __need for more than just two or three tables__ to be involved in order to join them. This is an area of `relationship()` where one seeks to _push the boundaries_ of what's possible, and often the ultimate solution to many of these _exotic use cases_ needs to be _hammered out_ on the SQLAlchemy mailing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more recent versions of SQLAlchemy, the `relationship.secondary` parameter can be used in some of these cases in order to provide a __composite target consisting of multiple tables__."
