    "#### Late-Evaluation of Relationship Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the examples in the preceding sections illustrate mappings where the various `relationship()` constructs __refer to their target classes using a string name__, rather than the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Parent(Base):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    children = relationship(\"Child\", back_populates=\"parent\")\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These _string names_ are __resolved into classes__ in the `mapper resolution stage`, which is an _internal process_ that occurs typically __after all mappings have been defined__ and is __normally triggered__ by the _first usage of the mappings_ themselves. The _registry_ object is the `container` in which these __names are stored and resolved to the mapped classes__ they refer towards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main class argument for `relationship()`, other arguments which depend upon the columns present on an as-yet undefined class may also be specified either as _Python functions_, or more commonly as _strings_. For most of these arguments except that of the main argument, __string inputs are evaluated as Python expressions__ using Python's built-in `eval()` function, as they are intended to receive complete SQL expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Warning\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As the Python `eval()` function is used to __interpret the late-evaluated string arguments__ passed to `relationship()` _mapper configuration construct_, these arguments __should not be repurposed__ such that they would receive untrusted user input; `eval()` is __not secure against untrusted user input__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _full namespace_ available within this evaluation __includes all classes mapped for this `declarative base`__, as well as the _contents of the sqlalchemy package_, including expression functions like `desc()` and `sqlalchemy.sql.functions.func`."
