    "> The _\"association table\"_ above has `foreign key constraints` established that refer to the two entity tables on either side of the relationship. The _data type_ of each of *association.left_id* and *association.right_id* is __normally inferred from that of the referenced table and may be omitted__. It is also __recommended__, though _not in any way required_ by SQLAlchemy, that the _columns which refer to the two entity tables_ are established within either a _unique constraint_ or more commonly as the _primary key constraint_; this ensures that __duplicate rows won't be persisted__ within the table regardless of issues on the application side.\n",

There is __no need to delete from this table manually__. The act of removing a record from the collection will have the effect of the row being deleted on flush.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several possibilities here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is a `relationship()` from Parent to Child, but there is not a _reverse-relationship_ that links a particular Child to each Parent, __SQLAlchemy will not have any awareness__ that when _deleting this particular Child object_, it needs to maintain the `\"secondary\"` table that _links it to the Parent_. __No delete of the \"secondary\" table will occur__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is a _relationship_ that links a particular Child to each Parent, suppose it's called `Child.parents`, SQLAlchemy _by default will load_ in the `Child.parents` collection to _locate all Parent objects_, and __remove each row from the \"secondary\" table which establishes this link__. Note that this _relationship_ __does not need__ to be `bidirectional`; SQLAlchemy is __strictly__ looking at every `relationship()` associated with the _Child object being deleted_.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A _higher performing option_ here is to use `ON DELETE CASCADE` directives with the _foreign keys used by the database_. Assuming the database supports this feature, the database itself can be made to __automatically delete rows__ in the `\"secondary\"` table as referencing rows in `\"child\"` are deleted. SQLAlchemy can be __instructed to forego actively loading__ in the `Child.parents` collection in this case using the `relationship.passive_deletes` directive on `relationship()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note again, these _behaviors_ are __only relevant__ to the `relationship.secondary` option used with `relationship()`. If dealing with _association tables_ that are __mapped explicitly__ and are __not present__ in the `relationship.secondary` option of a relevant `relationship()`, _cascade rules_ can be _used instead_ to __automatically delete entities__ in reaction to a related entity being deleted."
