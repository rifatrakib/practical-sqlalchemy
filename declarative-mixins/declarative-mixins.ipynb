    "#### Composing Mapped Hierarchies with Mixins\n",
    "\n",
    "A common need when _mapping classes using the Declarative style_ is to __share some functionality__, such as a `set of common columns`, `some common table options`, or `other mapped properties`, __across many classes__. The __standard Python idioms__ for this is to have the __classes inherit from a superclass__ which _includes these common features_.\n",
    "\n",
    "When _using declarative mappings_, this idiom is __allowed via the usage of mixin classes__, as well as __via augmenting the declarative base__ produced by either the `registry.generate_base()` method or `declarative_base()` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using _mixins_ or _abstract base classes_ with `Declarative`, a _decorator_ known as `declared_attr()` is __frequently used__. This _decorator_ allows the __creation of class methods__ that _produce a parameter or ORM construct_ that will be part of a _declarative mapping_. _Generating constructs using a callable_ allows for `Declarative` to get a _new copy of a particular kind of object each time it calls_ upon the `mixin` or `abstract base` on behalf of a __new class that's being mapped__."

    "Where above, the class `UserModel` will contain an `\"id\"` column as the `primary key`, a `__tablename__` attribute that __derives from the name of the class itself__, as well as `__table_args__` and `__mapper_args__` defined by the `CustomMixin` _mixin class_. The `declared_attr()` _decorator_ applied to a _classmethod_ called `def __tablename__(cls):` has the effect of _turning the method into a classmethod_ while also indicating to `Declarative` that _this attribute_ is __significant within the mapping__.\n",

    "> The use of the `declarative_mixin()` _class decorator_ __marks a particular class as providing the service of providing SQLAlchemy declarative assignments__ as a mixin for other classes.
